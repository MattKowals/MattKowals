Finished Projects:

1. A CLI application for managing a board game collection. The app has the general CRUD functions of adding, editing/updating, and deleting games. In addition, there is a statistics page that displays number of games including base vs expansions, number of games per publisher, and total cost of the collection. The user can sort the games and display all the games you have that allow for a certain number of players (You want to play alone? Find all games that have a solo mode. Want 5 players? Find all the games that can manage 5 players, etc). There is also an option to find a random game.
   - The app is built using Java in IntelliJ, the database is made using PostgreSQL. Also using Spring Boot, DAO, JDBC. This was built in a semi-agile framwork using a Trello board.

3. A full stack book enthusiast application. This is an online book hub that allows users to sign into an account, search for books using the Google Books API, add them to their "bookshelf," and mark books as read vs. unread. On the home page is a rotating sample collection of books from popular authors or series. In addition, there is a forum where users can add or respond to posts, plus a way for admin to delete posts if necessary. A user can add a book themselves as well. A Google Map of local bookstores is on the home page as well. Lastly, a book trivia section with three difficulty options was added with a randomized true/false question on the home page and a seperate page with randomized multiple choice questions.
  - This site was built with a Java backend, Vue.js and Javascript front end, and a PostgreSQL database. Other tools included Postman, Git, VueX, REST APIs, IntelliJ, JUnit


Current projects:

1. A front end website for a local small business. The website is functionally finished, just waiting on images and a few pieces of content. Site features multiple pages using a router, a flexbox to display the items, a carousel for pictures, and a Vuex store to hold data.
   - Recently spoke with the owner of the business and will add event handling to click on the items to display more information about them.
   - The site is built in Vue.js, utilizing HTML, CSS, Vuex

2. A Roman Numeral to number converter. The user can input either a number or a Roman Numeral and it will convert to the other. The number to Roman Numeral is complete and the Roman Numeral to number is close to complete.


Future Projects

1. A full stack reworking of the board game CLI app. Very early stages. Plan to add an API for board games through the BoardGameGeek API. This will have all of the functionality of the CLI app, along with searching for games, adding a want list, utilizing game genres for searching and sorting, and possibly a game shelf organizer that helps maximize shelf space (dependent on finding an API that includes game dimensions).
   - This site will be built with a Java backend, PostgreSQL database. Debating between React and Vue.js front end. Will also utilize JPA (Java Persistance API).
