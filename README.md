I am a junior softwaredeveloper and a recent Tech Elevator graduate!

I'm currently working on two projects:

1. A front end website for a local small business. The website is functionally finished, just waiting on images and a few pieces of content. Site features multiple pages using a router, a flexbox to display the items, a carousel for pictures, and a Vuex store to hold data.
   - Recently spoke with the owner of the business and will add event handling to click on the items to display more information about them.
   - The site is built in Vue.js, utilizing HTML, CSS, Vuex, 

  
3. A CLI application for managing a board game collection. The app has the general CRUD functions of adding, editing/updating, and deleting games. There is also a statistics page that displays number of games including base vs expansions, number of games per publisher, and total cost of the collection.
   -The next steps for the app are:
     1. Sorting algorithms to sort by time to play, number of players, or by title
     2. An option to type in a number of players and get all games that match
     3. Graph(s) to further the statistics page, maybe when games were purchased
   - The app is built using Java in IntelliJ, the database is made using PostgreSQL. Also using Spring Boot, DAO, JDBC
