2. A Roman Numeral to number converter. The user can input either a number or a Roman Numeral and it will convert to the other. The number to Roman Numeral is complete and the Roman Numeral to number is close to complete.


Finished Projects:

1. A CLI application for managing a board game collection. The app has the general CRUD functions of adding, editing/updating, and deleting games. In addition, there is a statistics page that displays number of games including base vs expansions, number of games per publisher, and total cost of the collection. The user can sort the games and display all the games you have that allow for a certain number of players (You want to play alone? Find all games that have a solo mode. Want 5 players? Find all the games that can manage 5 players, etc). There is also an option to find a random game.
   - The app is built using Java in IntelliJ, the database is made using PostgreSQL. Also using Spring Boot, DAO, JDBC
